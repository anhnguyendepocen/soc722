# Sociology 722

This is my attempt to convert my first-semester graduate stats course from PowerPoint to ioslides. 
The course is based on Kosuke Imai's *Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction*. I have used a few of the same 
images he uses in his slides, but mostly I try to recreate stuff from scratch.

The links to the compiled slides are below. This is very much a work in progress.
