## Review: A typical week

**Monday**: skim/read chapter; start DataCamp

**Tuesday**: lecture (possible quiz)

**Wednesday**: reread chapter; go through chapter code

**Thursday**: ask questions in lab, practice coding

**Friday-Sunday**: complete exercises, submit via Sakai


## Homework debrief


## Ask me **two questions** about the concepts


## Agenda for today

1. Review: why do experiments work

2. Review of descriptive statistics

3. Introduction to observational data

4. Simple approaches to causal inference with observational data


## Questions?


# 1. Review

## Why do experiments work? (Discuss)

# 2. Descriptive statistics

## Descriptive stats you need to know
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Quantiles (e.g., 25th, 75th)
- Interquartile range
- Standard deviation
- Variance

## Mean

- The **mean** is the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations
- Generally called the average
- "Center of gravity" of the distribution
