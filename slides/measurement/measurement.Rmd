# Homework debrief

Ask me two questions about the concepts

# Today's agenda

1. Surveys and sampling
2. Visualizing univariate data
3. Visualizing bivariate data
4. Measuring "class"

class: center, middle, inverse

# 1. Surveys and sampling

# Literary Digest poll, 1936

- Source: auto registrations, phone books
- 10 million straw poll ballots sent out
- 2.3 million returned
- Gallup used 50,000 respondents

.center[

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/litdigest.jpg")

# Quota sampling

- fixed quote of certain respondents for each interviewer
- sample resembles the population on these characteristics
- potential unobserved confounding $\rightarrow$ selection bias

---

# Probability sampling
- Ensures representativeness
- *Definition:* every unit in the population has a **known** non-zero probability of being selected
- *Simple random sampling:* every unit has an **equal** selection probability

# Difficulty of drawing a random sample

Problems of telephone survey
- Random digit dialing from phone book
- Cell phones (double counting for richer participants)
- Caller ID screening (unit non-response)

An alternative: Internet survey
- Opt-in panels, respondent driven sampling   
- non-probability sampling
- Cheap but non-representative
- Digital divide: rich vs. poor, young vs. old
- Correct for potential sampling bias via statistical methods
