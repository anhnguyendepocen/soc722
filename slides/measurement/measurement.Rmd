# Quota sampling

- fixed quota of certain respondents for each interviewer

- sample resembles the population on these characteristics

- potential unobserved confounding $\rightarrow$ selection bias



---

# Probability sampling

- Ensures representativeness

- **Definition:** every unit in the population has a *known* non-zero probability of being selected

- **Simple random sampling:** every unit has an *equal* selection probability


---

# An intuitive take on random sampling

# Difficulty of drawing a random sample

Problems of telephone survey
- random digit dialing from phone book
- cell phones (double counting for richer participants)
- caller ID screening (unit non-response)

--

An alternative: Internet survey
- opt-in panels, respondent driven sampling   
- non-probability sampling
- cheap but non-representative
- digital divide: rich vs. poor, young vs. old
- correct for potential sampling bias via statistical methods

class: center, middle, inverse

# 2. Visualizing a single variable

---

# Bring in the data

```{r echo = TRUE}
# bring in Stata dataset and remove labels

gss <- haven::read_dta(here("data", "GSS2018.dta")) %>% 
  haven::zap_labels()


# keep the variables I want and remove missing data

gss <- 
  gss %>% 
  select(wrkstat, sex, educ, age, conrinc, prestg10) %>% 
  drop_na()

```

---

# Distribution of age

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p <- ggplot(gss, aes( x = age )) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal()

```

---

# Histogram

```{r}
p

```

---

# Coarsened histogram

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p <- ggplot(gss, aes( x = age  )) +
  geom_histogram( color = "white" ,
                  breaks = seq(15, 90, 5)) +
  theme_minimal()

```

---

```{r}
p

```

---

# Density plot

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p <- ggplot(gss, aes( x = age )) +
  geom_line( stat = "density" ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

---

```{r}
p

```

---

# Using logarithms

- often used for skewed variables (e.g., populations, incomes)

- $y=\text{log}_b x$, where $b$ is a base and $x$ is a positive number

- if $b$ is 10, then

--

  - $\text{log}_{10}1000 = 3$

--
  
  - $\text{log}_{10}.02 = -2$
  
--

- we often will use base $e \approx 2.7182$, which has some particular advantages

.small[

```{r echo = TRUE}
data(gapminder, package = "dslabs")
gm2011 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter( year == 2011 ) %>% 
  mutate( log10pop = log10( population ) ) %>% 
  drop_na()

p1 <- ggplot( gm2011 , aes( x = population ) ) +
  geom_line( stat = "density" ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs( title = "Raw population" )

p2 <- ggplot( gm2011 , aes( x = log10pop ) ) +
  geom_line( stat = "density" ) +

# Calculating the z-score

z-score of $x_i =$ $$\frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{S_x}$$

where $\bar{x}$ is the mean of $x$

where $S_x$ is the standard deviation of $x$

---

# Standardizing

```{r echo = TRUE}
gss <- gss %>% 
  mutate( z_prestige = ( prestg10 - mean( prestg10 )) / 
            sd(prestg10) )
```

There are easier ways to do this, but this is the most transparent.

---

# Same shape, different scale

```{r}
ggplot( gss , aes( x = z_prestige )) +
  geom_line( stat = "density" ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

class: center, middle, inverse

# 3. Visualizing two variables

---

# Boxplot

```{r}
ggplot( gm2011 , aes( y = log10pop ,
                      x = continent , 
                      group = continent ) ) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs( y = "Population (log(10)" ,
        x = "Continent") +
  theme_minimal()

```

---

# Scatterplot

```{r}
ggplot( gm2011 , aes( x = gdp/population , y = life_expectancy ) ) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10( labels = scales::comma ) +
  labs( x = "GDP per capita" ,
        y = "Life expectancy"  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

---

# Scatterplot (with label)

```{r}
ggplot( gm2011 , aes( x = gdp/population , y = life_expectancy ) ) +
  geom_text( aes( label = country )) +
  scale_x_log10( labels = scales::comma ) +
  labs( x = "GDP per capita" ,
        y = "Life expectancy"  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

---

# Correlation (Pearson's _r_ )

$~$

$$r = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum^n_{i=1} \left( \frac{x_i-\bar{x}}{S_x}\times\frac{y_i-\bar{y}}{S_y} \right)$$

$~$

In other words, it's the average of the product of two variables' z-scores. It's a measure of how strongly two variables are associated.

---

# Correlation

- On average, how do two variables move together

- Positive (negative) correlation: When x is larger than its mean, y is likely (unlikely) to be larger than its mean

- Positive (negative) correlation: data cloud slopes up (down)

- High correlation: data cluster tightly around a line

---
class: small

# Correlation matrix

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gm2011 %>% 
  select( gdp , life_expectancy , fertility ) %>% 
  corrr::correlate( diagonal = 1 ) %>% 
  knitr::kable( format = "html" , digits = 2 )

```

---

# Scatterplot matrix

```{r}
gm2011 %>%
  mutate( gdpcap = (gdp / 1000) / population ) %>% 
  select( gdpcap , life_expectancy , fertility ) %>% 
  GGally::ggpairs() +
  theme_minimal()

```

Visualizing would help you see that GDP need to be transformed.

This is Anscombe's quartet. The means, SDs, and correlations are all the same! That's why to visualize.

class: middle, center, inverse

# 4. Measuring class
## (it's harder than it seems)

---

# Income, education, occupational prestige

```{r echo = FALSE}
class <- gss %>% 
  filter( wrkstat==1 ) %>% 
  select( educ , conrinc, prestg10 )

GGally::ggpairs( class ) + theme_minimal()

```

---

# Cluster analysis

```{r, echo = TRUE}
class <- class %>% 
  mutate( z_inc = scale( conrinc ) ,
          z_edu = scale( educ ) ,
          z_occ = scale( prestg10 ))

```

---

# Cluster analysis

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(9219)

# Do the cluster analysis (3 clusters) 
km3 <- 
  kmeans( select( class, starts_with("z_") ), 
          centers = 3 , 
          nstart = 5 )

# Add cluster assignment to the dataframe
class <- class %>% 
  mutate( cluster = km3$cluster )

```

---

# Results

```{r, echo = TRUE}

km3$size
km3$centers

```

---

# More variation within than between

```{r}
pp <- ggplot( class, aes( y = prestg10 , x = cluster , group = cluster ) ) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs( title = "Prestige" )

pe <- ggplot( class, aes( y = educ , x = cluster , group = cluster ) ) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs( title = "Education" )

pi <- ggplot( class, aes( y = conrinc , x = cluster , group = cluster ) ) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs( title = "Income" )

gridExtra::grid.arrange(pp, pe, pi, nrow = 1)

```

---

# This is too simple
## (and in reality much, much more complicated)

For example, [Weeden and Grusky (2005)](https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/media/_media/pdf/key_issues/social%20class_research.pdf) argue for 126 classes!

Various schemes have put the "true" number between 2 and 126 and some reject
the notion of categorical class membership all together. Yet we talk a lot 
about "class"!
